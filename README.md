Notes on scRNA-seq analysis

## Significance

scRNA-seq has emerged as a standard technology to study and enhance the 
understanding of transcription. The space here is dedicated to collect
papers, methods, tutorials, and stuff related to the technology. It has 
been more manually curated and content checked since 2020 April.
